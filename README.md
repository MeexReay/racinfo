## Host your Racinfo

It is strongly recommended to use Docker to host Racinfo. You can use the following command to run it:

```bash
docker build -t racinfo .
docker run -d -p 8085:8085 racinfo
```

By default, Racinfo runs on port 8085. You can change this by using the -p flag with the docker run command, like this:

```bash
# Instead of 8085, you can use any port you want, like 3000
docker run -d -p 3000:8085 racinfo
```

But if you don't want to use Docker, you can run it with local Node.js installation:

```bash
corepack enable pnpm && corepack install -g pnpm@latest
pnpm install 
pnpm build

# Replace 8085 with the port that you want to use
pnpm start --port 8085
```
